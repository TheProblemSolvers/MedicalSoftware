## Introduction


## Problem Statement
As healthcare systems have become more complex over the past 20 years, doctors have faced an increasingly difficult communication network with both their patients and other health care professionals (HCPs).  Manuel Marõn Sánchez, from the Department of Social Psychology of the University of Seville in Spain, highlighted the need for communication to be improved between HCP’s and patients (Sanchez, 2001).  While communication solutions currently exist for larger medical offices, market research indicates this problem is still relevant in medical offices with only one physician.

## Anticipated Consumers
Small, independent health care providers and their patients.
