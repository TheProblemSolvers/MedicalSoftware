# Web-based Medical Suite
## Introduction
In my fourth and final year of the Project Lead the Way (PLTW) course, I collaborated with two of my peers to identify a problem that exists in the world, and then to develop a solution for it. Over the course of a few months, we narrowed our focus to the medical industry, as it has become increasingly important in regards to the COVID-19 pandemic. As we dove deeper into the issues in the medical field, we discovered that a flawed communication system existed in many medical offices. Solutions exist, but most have vital flaws. The biggest flaw we found, however, is that most fully-functional commercial medical software is cost prohibitive. While large medical offices are able to justify such an expenditure, small, independent medical offices are forced to use outdated and error-prone methods of communication and data storage. This project’s aim is to develop a free-to-use computerized healthcare management solution, specifically so smaller medical offices can continue to function as independent practices. 

## About the Project
Our medical suite is web based, since it allows widespread accessibility, requires no downloads or installation, and is inherently multi-platform. We use the Apache web server to host our website, and a MySQL database to store records collected from users. However, this project is still in development. Plans for the future include the use of secure hypertext transfer protocol (HTTPS), dedicated server hardware, and ADA compliance. 

## Problem Statement
As healthcare systems have become more complex over the past 20 years, doctors have faced an increasingly difficult communication network with both their patients and other health care professionals (HCPs).  Manuel Marõn Sánchez, from the Department of Social Psychology of the University of Seville in Spain, highlighted the need for communication to be improved between HCP’s and patients (Sanchez, 2001).  While communication solutions currently exist for larger medical offices, market research indicates this problem is still relevant in medical offices with only one physician.

## Anticipated Consumers
Small, independent health care providers and their patients.
